# warframe-primetracker
Database to track Prime acquisition in Warframe

## Use
There is currently no user interface, so the tools can only be used through a
Python interpreter in interactive mode.

## Dependencies
- [python3 (>3.7.2)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [peewee (>3.8.2)](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/installation.html)
- [BeautifulSoup4 (>4.7.1)](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/#Download)
- [certifi (>2018.11.29)](https://github.com/certifi/python-certifi)
- [kivy (>1.10.1)](https://kivy.org/doc/stable/installation/installation.html)

The versions listed after each dependency are what I used while devloping this
tool. Newer versions will probably work, but older versions may not.
